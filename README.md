# shado-opengl-api

This is simplified version of unity game engine written from scratch in C++.
This engine supports:

- Adding, moving and deleting entities (with a nice editor)
- Attaching components to entities (with entt)
- Adding physics components to entities (with box2D)
- Adding different cameras
- Scripting using C# with an API similar to unity

This engine was built from scratch and uses the following the following libraries and technologies:

- GLFW and GLEW
- OpenGL with GLSL 4.1 shaders
- box2d for physics
- entt for entity component system
- ImGui and ImGuizmo for UI
- spdlog for debug and logging
- glm for math
- mono as a bridge between C# and C++
- yaml Cpp for serialization
